## Overview
This project is a React-based single-page application (SPA) portfolio designed to showcase a web developer's skills and work samples. The application provides potential employers and other visitors with a streamlined experience to learn about the developer, view their projects, and contact them directly. The portfolio is structured into several sections, each accessible via a navigation menu, ensuring that the most critical information is readily available.

### Key Features:
1. Responsive Design: The portfolio is fully responsive, ensuring an optimal viewing experience across different devices.
2. Navigation: The header includes a navigation bar that highlights the current section, with smooth transitions between sections.
3. Content Sections:
4. About Me: Includes the developer's recent photo or avatar and a short biography.
5. Portfolio: Showcases six of the developer's projects with images, titles, and links to both the deployed applications and their GitHub repositories.
6. Contact: A contact form for visitors to get in touch with the developer. The form includes validation to ensure that all fields are correctly filled.
7. Footer: Contains links to the developerâ€™s GitHub, LinkedIn, and a third platform like Stack Overflow or Twitter.
